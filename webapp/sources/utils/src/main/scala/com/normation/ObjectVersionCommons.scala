 * This file contains generic data about what is a versionned object in
 * Rudder. It's basically a git commitId, but git has several concept behind a commit id
 * that are too low level for us:
 * - a SHA (ObjectId): it's (maybe) a valid id which can point to a tree, a blob, a commit and
 *   certainly many other things;
 * - a Ref: it's a name (tag, branch, HEAD, etc) paired with the ObjectId it references
 *

  /**
   * A git name that can be resolve to somewhere in repository:
   * - a SHA commit id,
   * - a branch or tag name,
   * - a relative reference (HEAD~3 etc)
   *
   * Note that "master" actually means "last commit on master" and so is not fixed in time,
   * while "9f35b60b93f01123c13a02db06ccab0a6aa87110" (a specific sha1) is fixed in time.
   *
   * Naming idea:
   * - ObjectId:
   *   Git.ObjectId makes sense, but ObjectId is quite generic and non-informative. In the context of
   *   Rudder, it can even be misleading: object id is likely understood as directive/rule uuid
   *
   * - GitId:
   *   make it clear that we talk about a Git thing. It loose the idea that for rudder, it's about
   *   versioning/revision. And it can be misleading as our "git id" are not exactly what Git call
   *   an id (ie not only a SHA)
   *
   * - CommitId:
   *   Has the notion of revision and is tigly bound to "git" (or source control) in developer mind -
   *   but perhaps confusing because it's not always a real commit id (for ex: "master").
   *
   * - RevisionId:
   *   it allows to not explicitly talk about git in the context of rudder objects, which
   *   is perhaps good (avoid talking about implementation and more about what the thing is in the
   *   context of Rudder: Rule(uuid, revId). But perhaps that just add a layer for nothing, bluring
   *   concepts. And RevisionId is quite long.
   *
   *   I will go for "RevId" for now, perhaps need to change latter on.
